# Donate to pandas

WIP

Document content:

- Summary of why pandas needs funding
- Explain what the money will be spent on (with link to roadmap)
- Logos of NumFOCUS and pandas corporate sponsors
- Reviews of past donors (people can leave a comment when they donate)
- May be list of last stable release donors? (not sure if there is an API for that)
- Django got some stuff, may be we can copy other ideas too: <https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/>
