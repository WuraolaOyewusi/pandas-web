# About pandas

## History of development

In 2008, _pandas_ development began at [AQR Capital Management](http://www.aqr.com).
By the end of 2009 it had been [open sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source),
and is actively supported today by a community of like-minded individuals around the world who
contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source _pandas_
possible. Thank you to [all of our contributors](team.html).

Since 2015, _pandas_ is a [NumFOCUS sponsored project](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects).
This will help ensure the success of development of _pandas_ as a world-class open-source project.

## Library Highlights

- A fast and efficient **DataFrame** object for data manipulation with
  integrated indexing;

- Tools for **reading and writing data** between in-memory data structures and
  different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and
  the fast HDF5 format;

- Intelligent **data alignment** and integrated handling of **missing data**:
  gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate
  messy data into an orderly form;

- Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets;

- Intelligent label-based **slicing**, **fancy indexing**, and **subsetting**
  of large data sets;

- Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for **size
  mutability**;

- Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful **group by** engine
  allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;

- High performance **merging and joining** of data sets;

- **Hierarchical axis indexing** provides an intuitive way of working with
  high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;

- **Time series**-functionality: date range generation and frequency
  conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date
  shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time
  series without losing data;

- Highly **optimized for performance**, with critical code paths written in
  [Cython](http://www.cython.org/) or C.

- Python with *pandas* is in use in a wide variety of **academic and
  commercial** domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics,
  Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.
