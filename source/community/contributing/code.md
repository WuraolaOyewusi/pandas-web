# Contributing to the code base

## Code standards

Writing good code is not just about what you write. It is also about
*how* you write it. During Continuous Integration 
testing, several tools will be run to check your code for stylistic
errors. Generating any warnings will cause the test to fail. Thus, good
style is a requirement for submitting code to *pandas*.

There is a tool in pandas to help contributors verify their changes
before contributing them to the project:

    ./ci/code_checks.sh

The script verifies the linting of code files, it looks for common
mistake patterns (like missing spaces around sphinx directives that make
the documentation not being rendered properly) and it also validates the
doctests. It is possible to run the checks independently by using the
parameters `lint`, `patterns` and `doctests` (e.g.
`./ci/code_checks.sh lint`).

In addition, because a lot of people use our library, it is important
that we do not make sudden changes to the code that could have the
potential to break a lot of user code as a result, that is, we need it
to be as *backwards compatible* as possible to avoid mass breakages.

Additional standards are outlined on the [code style wiki page](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/wiki/Code-Style-and-Conventions).

## Optional dependencies

Optional dependencies (e.g. matplotlib) should be imported with the
private helper `pandas.compat._optional.import_optional_dependency`.
This ensures a consistent error message when the dependency is not met.

All methods using an optional dependency should include a test asserting
that an `ImportError` is raised when the optional dependency is not
found. This test should be skipped if the library is present.

All optional dependencies should be documented and the
minimum required version should be set in the
`pandas.compat._optional.VERSIONS` dict.

### C (cpplint)

*pandas* uses the
[Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) standard.
Google provides an open source style checker called `cpplint`, but we
use a fork of it that can be found
[here](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint). Here are *some* of the more
common `cpplint` issues:

-   we restrict line-length to 80 characters to promote readability
-   every header file must include a header guard to avoid name
    collisions if re-included

Continuous Integration
will run the [cpplint](https://pypi.org/project/cpplint) tool and report
any stylistic errors in your code. Therefore, it is helpful before
submitting code to run the check yourself:

    cpplint --extensions=c,h --headers=h --filter=-readability/casting,-runtime/int,-build/include_subdir modified-c-file

You can also run this command on an entire directory if necessary:

    cpplint --extensions=c,h --headers=h --filter=-readability/casting,-runtime/int,-build/include_subdir --recursive modified-c-directory

To make your commits compliant with this standard, you can install the
[ClangFormat](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) tool, which
can be downloaded [here](http://llvm.org/builds/). To configure, in your
home directory, run the following command:

    clang-format style=google -dump-config  > .clang-format

Then modify the file to ensure that any indentation width parameters are
at least four. Once configured, you can run the tool as follows:

    clang-format modified-c-file

This will output what your file will look like if the changes are made,
and to apply them, run the following command:

    clang-format -i modified-c-file

To run the tool on an entire directory, you can run the following
analogous commands:

    clang-format modified-c-directory/*.c modified-c-directory/*.h
    clang-format -i modified-c-directory/*.c modified-c-directory/*.h

Do note that this tool is best-effort, meaning that it will try to
correct as many errors as possible, but it may not correct *all* of
them. Thus, it is recommended that you run `cpplint` to double check and
make any other style fixes manually.

### Python (PEP8 / black)

*pandas* follows the [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
standard and uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to ensure a consistent code
format throughout the project.

Continuous Integration will run those tools and report any stylistic errors in your code.
Therefore, it is helpful before submitting code to run the check
yourself:

    black pandas
    git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff

to auto-format your code. Additionally, many editors have plugins that
will apply `black` as you edit files.

Optionally, you may wish to setup [pre-commit
hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run `black` and
`flake8` when you make a git commit. This can be done by installing
`pre-commit`:

    pip install pre-commit

and then running:

    pre-commit install

from the root of the pandas repository. Now `black` and `flake8` will be
run each time you commit changes. You can skip these checks with
`git commit --no-verify`.

This command will catch any stylistic errors in your changes
specifically, but be beware it may not catch all of them. For example,
if you delete the only usage of an imported function, it is
stylistically incorrect to import an unused function. However,
style-checking the diff will not catch this because the actual import is
not part of the diff. Thus, for completeness, you should run this
command, though it will take longer:

    git diff upstream/master --name-only -- "*.py" | xargs -r flake8

Note that on OSX, the `-r` flag is not available, so you have to omit it
and run this slightly modified command:

    git diff upstream/master --name-only -- "*.py" | xargs flake8

Windows does not support the `xargs` command (unless installed for
example via the [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) toolchain), but one can
imitate the behaviour as follows:

    for /f %i in ('git diff upstream/master --name-only -- "*.py"') do flake8 %i

This will get all the files being changed by the PR (and ending with
`.py`), and run `flake8` on them, one after the other.

### Import formatting

*pandas* uses [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) to standardise
import formatting across the codebase.

A guide to import layout as per pep8 can be found
[here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports/).

A summary of our current import sections ( in order ):

-   Future
-   Python Standard Library
-   Third Party
-   `pandas._libs`, `pandas.compat`, `pandas.util._*`, `pandas.errors`
    (largely not dependent on `pandas.core`)
-   `pandas.core.dtypes` (largely not dependent on the rest of
    `pandas.core`)
-   Rest of `pandas.core.*`
-   Non-core `pandas.io`, `pandas.plotting`, `pandas.tseries`
-   Local application/library specific imports

Imports are alphabetically sorted within these sections.

As part of Continuous Integration checks we run:

    isort --recursive --check-only pandas

to check that imports are correctly formatted as per the
``setup.cfg``.

If you see output like the below in Continuous Integration checks:

    Check import format using isort
    ERROR: /home/travis/build/pandas-dev/pandas/pandas/io/pytables.py Imports are incorrectly sorted
    Check import format using isort DONE
    The command "ci/code_checks.sh" exited with 1

You should run:

    isort pandas/io/pytables.py

to automatically format imports correctly. This will modify your local
copy of the files.

The ``--recursive`` flag can be passed to sort all files in a
directory.

You can then verify the changes look ok, then git commit and push.

### Backwards compatibility

Please try to maintain backward compatibility. *pandas* has lots of
users with lots of existing code, so don\'t break it if at all possible.
If you think breakage is required, clearly state why as part of the pull
request. Also, be careful when changing method signatures and add
deprecation warnings where needed. Also, add the deprecated sphinx
directive to the deprecated functions or methods.

If a function with the same arguments as the one being deprecated exist,
you can use the `pandas.util._decorators.deprecate`:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import deprecate

deprecate('old_func', 'new_func', '0.21.0')
```

Otherwise, you need to do it manually:

```python
import warnings

def old_func():
    """Summary of the function.

    .. deprecated:: 0.21.0
       Use new_func instead.
    """
    warnings.warn('Use new_func instead.', FutureWarning, stacklevel=2)
    new_func()


def new_func():
    pass
```

You'll also need to

1.  Write a new test that asserts a warning is issued when calling with
    the deprecated argument
2.  Update all of pandas existing tests and code to use the new argument

See contributing warnings for more.

## Testing with continuous integration

The *pandas* test suite will run automatically on
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Azure
Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/)
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted.
However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to
submitting the pull request, then the continuous integration services
need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here for
[Travis-CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) and
[Azure
Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/).

A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all
\'green\' build. If any tests are failing, then you will get a red
\'X\', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests.
This is an example of a green build.

![image](../_static/ci.png)

Each time you push to *your* fork, a *new* run of the tests will be
triggered on the CI. You can enable the auto-cancel feature, which
removes any non-currently-running tests for that same pull-request, for
[Travis-CI here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Building-only-the-latest-commit).

## Test-driven development/code writing

*pandas* is serious about testing and strongly encourages contributors
to embrace [test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). This
development process "relies on the repetition of a very short
development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing)
automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function,
then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test." So, before
actually writing any code, you should write your tests. Often the test
can be taken from the original GitHub issue. However, it is always worth
considering additional use cases and writing corresponding tests.

Adding tests is one of the most common requests after code is pushed to
*pandas*. Therefore, it is worth getting in the habit of writing tests
ahead of time so this is never an issue.

Like many packages, *pandas* uses [pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
and the convenient extensions in [numpy.testing](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html).

The earliest supported pytest version is 4.0.2.

### Writing tests

All tests should go into the `tests` subdirectory of the specific
package. This folder contains many current examples of tests, and we
suggest looking to these for inspiration. If your test requires working
with files or network connectivity, there is more information on the
[testing page](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/wiki/Testing)
of the wiki.

The `pandas.util.testing` module has many special `assert` functions
that make it easier to make statements about whether Series or DataFrame
objects are equivalent. The easiest way to verify that your code is
correct is to explicitly construct the result you expect, then compare
the actual result to the expected correct result:

    def test_pivot(self):
        data = {
            'index' : ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'B', 'A'],
            'columns' : ['One', 'One', 'One', 'Two', 'Two', 'Two'],
            'values' : [1., 2., 3., 3., 2., 1.]
        }

        frame = DataFrame(data)
        pivoted = frame.pivot(index='index', columns='columns', values='values')

        expected = DataFrame({
            'One' : {'A' : 1., 'B' : 2., 'C' : 3.},
            'Two' : {'A' : 1., 'B' : 2., 'C' : 3.}
        })

        assert_frame_equal(pivoted, expected)

### Transitioning to `pytest`

*pandas* existing test structure is *mostly* classed based, meaning that
you will typically find tests wrapped in a class.

```python
class TestReallyCoolFeature:
    pass
```

Going forward, we are moving to a more *functional* style using the
[pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework, which offers a
richer testing framework that will facilitate testing and developing.
Thus, instead of writing test classes, we will write test functions like
this:

```python
def test_really_cool_feature():
    pass
```

### Using `pytest`

Here is an example of a self-contained set of tests that illustrate
multiple features that we like to use.

-   functional style: tests are like `test_*` and *only* take arguments
    that are either fixtures or parameters
-   `pytest.mark` can be used to set metadata on test functions, e.g.
    `skip` or `xfail`.
-   using `parametrize`: allow testing of multiple cases
-   to set a mark on a parameter, `pytest.param(..., marks=...)` syntax
    should be used
-   `fixture`, code for object construction, on a per-test basis
-   using bare `assert` for scalars and truth-testing
-   `tm.assert_series_equal` (and its counter part
    `tm.assert_frame_equal`), for pandas object comparisons.
-   the typical pattern of constructing an `expected` and comparing
    versus the `result`

We would name this file `test_cool_feature.py` and put in an appropriate
place in the `pandas/tests/` structure.

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

@pytest.mark.parametrize('dtype', ['int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64'])
def test_dtypes(dtype):
    assert str(np.dtype(dtype)) == dtype

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'dtype', ['float32', pytest.param('int16', marks=pytest.mark.skip),
              pytest.param('int32', marks=pytest.mark.xfail(
                  reason='to show how it works'))])
def test_mark(dtype):
    assert str(np.dtype(dtype)) == 'float32'

@pytest.fixture
def series():
    return pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

@pytest.fixture(params=['int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64'])
def dtype(request):
    return request.param

def test_series(series, dtype):
    result = series.astype(dtype)
    assert result.dtype == dtype

    expected = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=dtype)
    tm.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```

A test run of this yields

```shell
((pandas) bash-3.2$ pytest  test_cool_feature.py  -v
=========================== test session starts ===========================
platform darwin -- Python 3.6.2, pytest-3.6.0, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.4.0
collected 11 items

tester.py::test_dtypes[int8] PASSED
tester.py::test_dtypes[int16] PASSED
tester.py::test_dtypes[int32] PASSED
tester.py::test_dtypes[int64] PASSED
tester.py::test_mark[float32] PASSED
tester.py::test_mark[int16] SKIPPED

tester.py::test_series[int8] PASSED
tester.py::test_series[int16] PASSED
tester.py::test_series[int32] PASSED
tester.py::test_series[int64] PASSED
```

Tests that we have `parametrized` are now accessible via the test name,
for example we could run these with `-k int8` to sub-select *only* those
tests which match `int8`.

```shell
((pandas) bash-3.2$ pytest  test_cool_feature.py  -v -k int8
=========================== test session starts ===========================
platform darwin -- Python 3.6.2, pytest-3.6.0, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.4.0
collected 11 items

test_cool_feature.py::test_dtypes[int8] PASSED
test_cool_feature.py::test_series[int8] PASSED
```

### Using `hypothesis`

Hypothesis is a library for property-based testing. Instead of
explicitly parametrizing a test, you can describe *all* valid inputs and
let Hypothesis try to find a failing input. Even better, no matter how
many random examples it tries, Hypothesis always reports a single
minimal counterexample to your assertions - often an example that you
would never have thought to test.

See [Getting Started with
Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/articles/getting-started-with-hypothesis/)
for more of an introduction, then refer to the
[Hypothesis documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
for details.

```python
import json
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

any_json_value = st.deferred(lambda: st.one_of(
    st.none(), st.booleans(), st.floats(allow_nan=False), st.text(),
    st.lists(any_json_value), st.dictionaries(st.text(), any_json_value)
))


@given(value=any_json_value)
def test_json_roundtrip(value):
    result = json.loads(json.dumps(value))
    assert value == result
```

This test shows off several useful features of Hypothesis, as well as
demonstrating a good use-case: checking properties that should hold over
a large or complicated domain of inputs.

To keep the Pandas test suite running quickly, parametrized tests are
preferred if the inputs or logic are simple, with Hypothesis tests
reserved for cases with complex logic or where there are too many
combinations of options or subtle interactions to test (or think of!)
all of them.

### Testing warnings

By default, one of pandas CI workers will fail if any unhandled warnings
are emitted.

If your change involves checking that a warning is actually emitted, use
`tm.assert_produces_warning(ExpectedWarning)`.

```python
import pandas.util.testing as tm

df = pd.DataFrame()
with tm.assert_produces_warning(FutureWarning):
    df.some_operation()
```

We prefer this to the `pytest.warns` context manager because ours checks
that the warning\'s stacklevel is set correctly. The stacklevel is what
ensure the *user\'s* file name and line number is printed in the
warning, rather than something internal to pandas. It represents the
number of function calls from user code (e.g. `df.some_operation()`) to
the function that actually emits the warning. Our linter will fail the
build if you use `pytest.warns` in a test.

If you have a test that would emit a warning, but you aren\'t actually
testing the warning itself (say because it\'s going to be removed in the
future, or because we\'re matching a 3rd-party library\'s behavior),
then use `pytest.mark.filterwarnings` to ignore the error.

```python
@pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:msg:category")
def test_thing(self):
    ...
```

If the test generates a warning of class `category` whose message starts
with `msg`, the warning will be ignored and the test will pass.

If you need finer-grained control, you can use Python\'s usual [warnings
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) to control
whether a warning is ignored / raised at different places within a
single test.

```python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore", FutureWarning)
    # Or use warnings.filterwarnings(...)
```

Alternatively, consider breaking up the unit test.

## Running the test suite

The tests can then be run directly inside your Git clone (without having
to install *pandas*) by typing:

    pytest pandas

The tests suite is exhaustive and takes around 20 minutes to run. Often
it is worth running only a subset of tests first around your changes
before running the entire suite.

The easiest way to do this is with:

    pytest pandas/path/to/test.py -k regex_matching_test_name

Or with one of the following constructs:

    pytest pandas/tests/[test-module].py
    pytest pandas/tests/[test-module].py::[TestClass]
    pytest pandas/tests/[test-module].py::[TestClass]::[test_method]

Using [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist), one can
speed up local testing on multicore machines. To use this feature, you
will need to install pytest-xdist via:

    pip install pytest-xdist

Two scripts are provided to assist with this. These scripts distribute
testing across 4 threads.

On Unix variants, one can type:

    test_fast.sh

On Windows, one can type:

    test_fast.bat

This can significantly reduce the time it takes to locally run tests
before submitting a pull request.

For more, see the [pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
documentation.

Furthermore one can run

```python
pd.test()
```

with an imported pandas to run tests similarly.

## Running the performance test suite

Performance matters and it is worth considering whether your code has
introduced performance regressions. *pandas* is in the process of
migrating to [asv benchmarks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv) to
enable easy monitoring of the performance of critical *pandas*
operations. These benchmarks are all found in the `pandas/asv_bench`
directory. asv supports both python2 and python3.

To use all features of asv, you will need either `conda` or
`virtualenv`. For more details please check the
[asv installation webpage](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).

To install asv:

    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv

If you need to run a benchmark, change your directory to `asv_bench/`
and run:

    asv continuous -f 1.1 upstream/master HEAD

You can replace `HEAD` with the name of the branch you are working on,
and report benchmarks that changed by more than 10%. The command uses
`conda` by default for creating the benchmark environments. If you want
to use virtualenv instead, write:

    asv continuous -f 1.1 -E virtualenv upstream/master HEAD

The `-E virtualenv` option should be added to all `asv` commands that
run benchmarks. The default value is defined in `asv.conf.json`.

Running the full test suite can take up to one hour and use up to 3GB of
RAM. Usually it is sufficient to paste only a subset of the results into
the pull request to show that the committed changes do not cause
unexpected performance regressions. You can run specific benchmarks
using the `-b` flag, which takes a regular expression. For example, this
will only run tests from a `pandas/asv_bench/benchmarks/groupby.py`
file:

    asv continuous -f 1.1 upstream/master HEAD -b ^groupby

If you want to only run a specific group of tests from a file, you can
do it using `.` as a separator. For example:

    asv continuous -f 1.1 upstream/master HEAD -b groupby.GroupByMethods

will only run the `GroupByMethods` benchmark defined in `groupby.py`.

You can also run the benchmark suite using the version of `pandas`
already installed in your current Python environment. This can be useful
if you do not have virtualenv or conda, or are using the
`setup.py develop` approach discussed above; for the in-place build you
need to set `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.
`PYTHONPATH="$PWD/.." asv [remaining arguments]`. You can run benchmarks
using an existing Python environment by:

    asv run -e -E existing

or, to use a specific Python interpreter,:

    asv run -e -E existing:python3.5

This will display stderr from the benchmarks, and use your local
`python` that comes from your `$PATH`.

Information on how to write a benchmark and how to use asv can be found
in the [asv documentation](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_benchmarks.html).

## Documenting your code

Changes should be reflected in the release notes located in
`doc/source/whatsnew/vx.y.z.rst`. This file contains an ongoing change
log for each release. Add an entry to this file to document your fix,
enhancement or (unavoidable) breaking change. Make sure to include the
GitHub issue number when adding your entry (using `` :issue:`1234 ``
where ``1234`` is the issue/pull request
number).

If your code is an enhancement, it is most likely necessary to add usage
examples to the existing documentation. This can be done following the
section regarding documentation above.
Further, to let users know when this feature was added, the
`versionadded` directive is used. The sphinx syntax for that is:

This will put the text *New in version 0.21.0* wherever you put the
sphinx directive. This should also be put in the docstring when adding a
new function or method
([example](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.20.2/pandas/core/frame.py#L1495))
or a new keyword argument
([example](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.20.2/pandas/core/generic.py#L568)).
