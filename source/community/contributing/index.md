# Contributing to pandas

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

If you are brand new to pandas or open-source development, we recommend going through the
[GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) to find issues that interest you.
There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open)
and [good first issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open)
where you could start out. Once you've found an interesting issue, you can return here to get your development environment setup.

Feel free to ask questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\#!forum/pydata) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas).
